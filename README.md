# decision-trees-cancer-prediction-
An example of predicting breast cancer using existing data to learn with decision trees (scikit-learn/python)


###### WORKING ######

The collected data sample has been divided into test and training samples.
Using the scikit's decision tree generator and the traning set, is used to
generate a tree based on ID3.

The test data can then be used to cross verify the accuracy of the tree 
generated.

This small program also generates a pdf to visualize the generated tree.
